# Voice123 test

## Application setup guide.
- **Installation**: `npm install`
- **Test**: `npm run test`
- **Run App**: install first and run `npm run dev` 

## Worklog

- Setting up the needed dependencies, testing kit, libraries, framework and git repo
    - Time Spent: 3 hours <br>
    This was easy but with a little itch while setting up the testing kit to work with the latest version of NextJs
- Added the HomePage UI
    - Time Spent: 2 hours <br>
- Added the SearchPage UI
    - Time Spent: 8 hours+ <br>
    There were a lot of design choices to make and above all, building the AudioPlayer from scratch to fit my preferred design took a lot of my time. It was easy to setup it up but there were hidden performance issues that took a while to fix. Also, a lot more responsiveness had to be done on the SearchPage
- Integrated the UI Pages with the Voice123 search API
  - Time Spent: 6 hours+ <br>
  This was straight forward but User Experience took most of time here.

## Future improvements and recommendations.
- I will like to add integration test and improve the unit testing
- The responsiveness was only done 90% of the way. There are slight issues on mobile
